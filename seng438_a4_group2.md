# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

We would go explore the amazon website seacrhing for good functionality to test. After determining a 
function to test we would explore what elements are different on each screen to choose what to use as
our validation point. From there we would do a dry run of the steps do perform that test. Afterwards, 
we start a recording in selenium and perform the steps again. Finally, we executed the test a few times to
verify that no errors were present.

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# How did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
